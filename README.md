## This repository aim is to explain the differences between FPGAs and ASICs

- [Differences in FPGA based design approach and ASIC based design approach](https://github.com/visionvlsi/FPGAvsASIC/blob/main/1majorDifferences.md)
- [Concise differences in design approaches](https://github.com/visionvlsi/FPGAvsASIC/blob/main/2conciseDiffrences.md)
- [Differences in the context of Physical design also known as backend design PART-1](https://github.com/visionvlsi/FPGAvsASIC/blob/main/3PNRbasedDifferences.md)
- [Differences in the context of Physical design also known as backend design PART-2](https://github.com/visionvlsi/FPGAvsASIC/blob/main/4PNRinFPGA_ASIC.md)
- [Differences in layout point of view](https://github.com/visionvlsi/FPGAvsASIC/blob/main/5layoutInFPGA.md)
- [Do FPGAs have logic gates to implement the logic?](https://github.com/visionvlsi/FPGAvsASIC/blob/main/6gatesInsideFPGA.md)
