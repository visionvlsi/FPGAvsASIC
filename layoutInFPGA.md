#### is layout happens in FPGA design approach?

<p align="justify">Layout, in the traditional sense of physical design, is not part of the FPGA design process. FPGA architectures are already defined and manufactured by FPGA vendors. These architectures consist of a pre-designed array of configurable logic blocks (CLBs), programmable interconnects, I/O elements, and other necessary components.</p>

<p align="justify">During FPGA design, the focus is on the high-level synthesis and implementation stages, where the designer defines the functionality and behavior of the circuit using hardware description languages (HDLs) such as VHDL or Verilog. The synthesis tool then maps the design onto the available resources of the FPGA architecture, performs placement and routing within the pre-defined programmable fabric, and generates a bitstream file that configures the FPGA.</p>

<p align="justify">While FPGA designers do not engage in layout activities, they still need to consider some physical constraints during the design process, such as timing, resource utilization, and I/O pin placement. These considerations are important to ensure that the design can be efficiently mapped and implemented within the FPGA architecture.</p>

<p align="justify">In contrast, ASIC design involves the complete physical design flow, including floor planning, placement, clock tree synthesis, and routing. ASIC designers have control over the physical layout of the chip, allowing them to optimize for performance, power, and area requirements.</p>

<p align="justify">It's worth noting that there are emerging FPGA technologies, such as structured ASICs and eFPGAs, where a customizable fabric is integrated into an ASIC. In these cases, the FPGA fabric is designed using a traditional layout flow. However, in the more common traditional FPGA design approach, layout activities are not performed by the FPGA designer.</p>
